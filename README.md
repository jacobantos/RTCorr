# RTCorr
Real Time Tracking Software 

The software tool RTCorr (Real-Time Correlation) for real-time optical measurement of displacements. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for placement and management of virtual extensometers, setting DIC parameters, and export of data. The program is capable of accomplishing simultaneous measurements of relative displacements in 2D using an arbitrary number of virtual extensometers, equivalent to physical ones. A full-field 2D DIC analysis can be carried out once the measurement is finished from the acquired images that are saved (if required) to a project folder. The measurement can be scaled to physical units. Otherwise, it is carried out in pixels.
